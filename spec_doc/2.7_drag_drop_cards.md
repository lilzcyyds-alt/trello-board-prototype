# 2.7 Drag & Drop — Cards (Reorder + Cross-list Move)

## Summary
Enable dragging cards to reorder within a list and move across lists, including moving between the Board and the Inbox.

## Requirements
- Dragging a card:
  - Reorder within same list
  - Move to different list (drop onto list body or between cards)
  - Move between Inbox and Board lists freely.
- Visual feedback:
  - Drag overlay/ghost preview (preferred)
  - Placeholder spacing during drag (optional)

## Acceptance Criteria
- Reordering within list updates state correctly
- Moving across lists updates both source and destination lists
- Drag interaction is smooth and predictable

## Implementation Notes (later)
- Use `dnd-kit` Sortable for cards
- Use consistent id scheme, e.g., `card:<cardId>`
- **Collision Detection**: Uses `rectIntersection` for improved container/item detection accuracy.
- **Droppable Zones**: The entire Inbox column (`aside` element) acts as a droppable zone to maximize drop target size.
- **Bi-directional**: Cards can be moved freely between Inbox and any Board list. Dynamic container lookup ensures cards are tracked correctly during the drag session.
