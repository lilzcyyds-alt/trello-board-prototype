# 2.2 Navigation Components

## Summary
Navigation is split between the persistent left Inbox column and a bottom floating navigation dock.

## Components

### 1. Persistent Left Column (Inbox)
- Acts as a primary area for incoming tasks.
- See `2.1_inbox_page.md` for details.

### 2. Bottom Navigation Dock
- A floating, rounded dock at the bottom center of the screen.
- Interaction Logic: Uses **state-based toggling** instead of standard routing.
- Nav Items:
  - **Inbox**: Toggles the visibility of the Inbox view.
  - **Board**: Toggles the visibility of the Board view.
- Constraints: The UI prevents hiding both Inbox and Board simultaneously.

## Requirements
- Selected item in the dock should have a distinct active state (e.g., blue background with shadow).
- Layout Transition: Layout updates instantly when toggled (no animation as per user request).
- Visual fidelity: Glassmorphism/Translucent dark background (`bg-slate-900/90 backdrop-blur-xl`).
