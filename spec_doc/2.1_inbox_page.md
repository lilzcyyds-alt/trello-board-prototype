# 2.1 Inbox Page

## Summary
Provide a simplified Trello-like Inbox view that acts as a left-side persistent column, allowing for quick card creation and viewing.

## Layout & Appearance
- Position: Persistent left panel when side-by-side (fixed width 320px), or full screen.
- Theme: Dark background color (#0d3375).
- Border: Styled with a #424957 border and `rounded-2xl` corners.
- Layering: Floats on the #23272e background with a large shadow.
- Integration: Can appear side-by-side with the Board view or in solo mode.
- Full Screen Logic: In solo mode, content centers to a maximum width for optimal readability on large screens within its rounded container.

## Requirements
- Content area shows an Inbox title with an icon and list of items.
- Top section: "Add a card" input field with two states (collapsed/expanded).
  - Expanded state: Compact composer with an auto-resizing textarea (starts at one line height).
  - Composer colors: Container `#101204`, Textarea `#22272b`.
  - Buttons: "Add card" (`#579dff`), "Cancel" (text-only).
- Visual elements:
  - Header icon: `Inbox` icon next to title.
  - Card items: Completion circle (`Circle` icon) to the left of the title (hidden by default, appears on hover).
  - Bottom lock icon: "Inbox is only visible to you".
- Interactions:
  - Hover states on list items:
    - Background color change.
    - Completion circle fades in from the left.
    - Title text indents to the right to make room for the circle.
  - Completion flow:
    - Click on completion circle triggers a "pop" animation and fills the circle with green.
    - A "blast" particle effect radiates from the circle.
    - The item remains visible for 800ms before starting an exit animation.
    - Exit animation (400ms): Row fades out and slides to the left.
    - During animation, circle and indentation remain visible even if mouse leaves.
  - Textarea auto-expands as content is typed.
## Acceptance Criteria
- Inbox page renders without errors
- Items are visually aligned with Trello-like spacing and typography
- Selecting/hovering feels responsive and consistent

## Notes
- Inbox items can be backed by the same `Card` model used on Board (mocked)
