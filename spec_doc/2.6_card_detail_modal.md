# 2.6 Card Detail Modal (Lightweight)

## Summary
A minimal modal to view/edit a card.

## ⚠️ Implementation Status
**NOT IMPLEMENTED** - This feature was not included in the current implementation. Cards do not open a modal when clicked.

## Requirements (Planned but not implemented)
- Opens when a card is clicked
- Shows:
  - Card title (editable input)
  - Description (textarea; optional)
  - Close button
- Basic accessibility:
  - Escape closes
  - Click backdrop closes (optional)

## Acceptance Criteria
- Modal opens/closes reliably
- Edits update in-memory state
- Styling matches app theme

## Notes
- Keep this lightweight; avoid overbuilding
- **Current behavior**: Cards have completion circle interaction and drag-and-drop functionality, but do not open a detail modal
