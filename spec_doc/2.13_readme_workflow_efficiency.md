# 2.13 README + Workflow Efficiency Report

## Summary
Prepare the submission narrative and required documentation.

## Requirements
- README must include:
  - What was replicated (exact reference: Trello Inbox + Board)
  - How to run locally
  - Libraries used (Next.js, Tailwind, dnd-kit, etc.)
  - AI/tools used (Cursor/Copilot/ChatGPT) if any
  - Workflow Efficiency Report (1–2 concrete tactics)

## Suggested Efficiency Report bullets
- Used Tailwind utility classes + small reusable components to iterate quickly while keeping consistent spacing/typography.
- Used AI-assisted scaffolding for component skeletons and state reducers, then manual pixel-tuning for fidelity.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Reviewer can run project in < 2 minutes
- Doc clearly explains tradeoffs and tool usage
