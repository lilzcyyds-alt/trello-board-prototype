# 2.3 Board Page (Layout + Header)

## Summary
Main board view with header and list columns in a horizontal scroll container.

## Requirements
- Route: `/board/[id]` (single board is fine; id can be hardcoded like `demo`)
- Header elements (pick a minimal subset):
  - Board title
  - 2–3 action buttons (e.g., Star, Share, More)
- Body:
  - Lists/columns rendered horizontally
  - Board background and padding similar to Trello

## Acceptance Criteria
- Board page loads with mock board state
- Columns display in correct order (from `listOrder`)
- Horizontal scroll works on smaller screens
