# 2.11 Resizable Layout & Responsiveness

## Summary
Ensure the UI is dynamic with a resizable divider between Inbox and Board, and behaves well across window sizes.

## Requirements
- **Resizable Divider**:
  - Vertical draggable bar between Inbox and Board.
  - Visual handle highlights on hover/drag.
  - Smooth real-time resizing.
- **Resistance & Snap-to-Close**:
  - Inbox Minimum Width: 272px (threshold to close: 240px).
  - Board Minimum Width: 375px (threshold to close: 340px).
  - Dragging below minimum width applies a "resistance factor" (slower movement).
  - Releasing mouse in the "close zone" triggers auto-closing of the panel.
  - Visual feedback: Panel becomes semi-transparent when in the "close zone".
- **Safety**:
  - At least one panel must remain visible; dragging cannot close the last active panel.
- **Lists container**:
  - Horizontal scroll when lists overflow
  - Smooth scrolling; avoid layout jumps
- **Basic responsiveness**:
  - Sidebar collapses or stays fixed
  - Board header remains readable

## Acceptance Criteria
- On small viewport, lists can be scrolled horizontally
- Resizable divider correctly adjusts Inbox and Board widths
- Snap-to-close behavior works correctly for both panels
- No overlapping or broken layout during drag actions
