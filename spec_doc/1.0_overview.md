# 1.0 Overview

## Goal
Build a high-fidelity functional prototype that replicates **Trello-like Inbox + Board** experience with strong visual accuracy and smooth interactions within a tight timebox.

## Scope (this project)
- Two primary views with dynamic visibility:
  - **Inbox** (simplified, toggleable)
  - **Board** (lists + cards, toggleable)
- Layout Modes:
  - **2-Layer Design**: A unified background layer (#23272e) with panels floating on top.
  - **Panels**: Inbox and Board are rendered as rounded-corner panels (`rounded-2xl`) with borders (#424957).
  - **Side-by-Side**: Both Inbox and Board are visible. Inbox width is adjustable (min 272px), Board occupies the remaining width (min 375px).
  - **Resizable Layout**: A draggable vertical divider allows adjusting the relative width between Inbox and Board.
  - **Snap-to-Close**: Dragging a panel beyond its minimum width triggers a "resistance" zone. Dragging further beyond a threshold (Inbox: 240px, Board: 340px) and releasing will automatically close that panel.
  - **Full Screen**: If only one view is active, it occupies the entire screen area within the padded layout.
  - **Constraints**: At least one view must be active at all times.
- Focus on:
  - Pixel-level UI fidelity (spacing, typography, colors, shadows)
  - 2-layer depth effect with shadows and rounded containers.
  - Interaction fidelity (hover/active/focus states, drag & drop)
  - Clean, modular component structure
- Data:
  - Mocked/stubbed data is acceptable
  - Simple persistence (LocalStorage) is acceptable

## Non-goals
- No real authentication
- No real multi-user collaboration
- No production-grade backend or database requirement
- No content/marketing pages (spec section 3.0+ not used)

## Target stack (implementation later)
- Next.js (Pages Router)
- TailwindCSS
- dnd-kit
- LocalStorage persistence

## Deliverables
- Running app + source repo
- README: reference target, libraries/AI used, workflow efficiency report
