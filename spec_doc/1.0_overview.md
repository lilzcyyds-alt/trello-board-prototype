# 1.0 Overview

## Goal
Build a high-fidelity functional prototype that replicates **Trello-like Inbox + Board** experience with strong visual accuracy and smooth interactions within a tight timebox.

## Scope (this project)
- Two primary views:
  - **Inbox** (simplified)
  - **Board** (lists + cards)
- Focus on:
  - Pixel-level UI fidelity (spacing, typography, colors, shadows)
  - Interaction fidelity (hover/active/focus states, drag & drop)
  - Clean, modular component structure
- Data:
  - Mocked/stubbed data is acceptable
  - Simple persistence (LocalStorage) is acceptable

## Non-goals
- No real authentication
- No real multi-user collaboration
- No production-grade backend or database requirement
- No content/marketing pages (spec section 3.0+ not used)

## Target stack (implementation later)
- Next.js (Pages Router)
- TailwindCSS
- dnd-kit
- LocalStorage persistence

## Deliverables
- Running app + source repo
- README: reference target, libraries/AI used, workflow efficiency report
