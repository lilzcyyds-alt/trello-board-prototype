# 2.9 Persistence — LocalStorage

## Summary
Persist board state locally to survive refreshes without building a backend.

## Requirements
- On app load:
  - If LocalStorage has saved state, load it
  - Else initialize from mock data
- On state updates:
  - Save to LocalStorage (debounced optional)
- Provide a reset mechanism (optional): "Reset demo data"

## Acceptance Criteria
- Refreshing the page retains lists/cards/order
- No crashes when LocalStorage is empty/corrupt (fallback to mock)

## Notes
- Document in README as a deliberate speed/efficiency tradeoff
