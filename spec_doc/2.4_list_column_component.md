# 2.4 List Column Component

## Summary
A Trello-like list/column containing a title and a vertical stack of cards.

## Requirements
- Shows list title with "click-to-edit" renaming support.
- Shows list background color (supports multiple calendar-like colors).
- Action menu (three dots in header):
  - "Delete list" option with confirmation.
- Shows card count (optional)
- Contains cards area:
  - Card list spacing matches reference
  - Empty state handled ("No cards" or blank area)
- Add-card UI:
  - Compact composer with auto-resizing textarea.
  - Buttons: "Add card" (primary blue), "Cancel" (text-only button).
  - Matches the behavior and style of the Inbox composer.

## Acceptance Criteria
- List renders consistently with multiple cards and with zero cards
- Column width and spacing feels Trello-like
- Composer expands dynamically to match text input.
- Column is usable as a drag-and-drop container for cards (see 2.7)
